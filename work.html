            <h4>January 2019 - Present</h4>
            <p>Orange Umbrella is a full-service student-run communication agency that operates out of the IMC in the University of Miami School of Communication. I have had the pleasure of working as a designer and creative director during my semesters in OU. We've been able to work with many clients, participate in job shadow and networking opportunities, as well as hosting social media workshops and fun cultural events.</p>

            <p>Over the summer of 2019, I interned at D'Adamo Personalized Nutrition in Norwalk, CT. I contributed to the development of their social media presence on instagram, curating stories and feed posts, as well as creating content for bi-monthly newsletters. I learned how to utilize MailChimp software and effectively plan out social media calendars.</p>

            <h4>August 2017 - Present</h4>
            <p>As a creative advertising major, I have been able to work on a variety of projects for classes since my freshman year of college.

          <h3>Art</h3>
          <article>
            <h4>1999 - Present</h4>
            <p>Ever since I was a young toddler, I have always loved art. It was a constant pass-time of mine that I enjoyed very much. I've taken multiple art classes in both college and highschool where I have discovered my love specifically for photography and graphic design. You can find some of my work in my portfolio <a href="https://miami.app.box.com/s/u2bqsekk7wi2ch2teni5id27jndxrv6a">here</a>.</p>
